# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the AI-Powered Pizza Delivery Chatbot!

Quick guidelines:

- Fork the repository and create a short-lived feature branch (`feature/your-feature`).
- Open a clear, focused pull request with a short description and any relevant screenshots or logs.
- Keep changes small and scoped to a single purpose.
- Run existing quick tests (see `scripts/simulate_agent.py`) and ensure any new code includes basic tests or usage instructions.
- Follow repository style and add documentation updates when appropriate.

If you want to propose larger changes, open an issue first to discuss design and approach.

Thanks — maintainers
